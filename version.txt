------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4.1 (24-JUNE-2022):

- Fix some bugs in create_polygonal_mesh.m
- Fix several bugs in the writing of output files. Affected functions: 
    postprocess_numerical_solution_linelast2d.m
    write_solution_txt_linelast2d.m
    plot_numerical_solution_poisson2d.m
    postprocess_numerical_solution_poisson2d.m
    write_solution_CPP_poisson2d.m
    write_solution_txt_poisson2d.m
    write_solution_GiD_poisson2d.m
- Optimize function T3toPolyMesh.m 

Version 2.4 (12-JANUARY-2022):

- Add several options in plot_and_output_options.m. New options:
   delete existing output files, plot front/isometric view of the figure,
   print and save pdf figures, save .fig figures, set figure resolution, color system 
   for the colorbar, colorbar ticks and lines, figure ticks, figure grid, set min/max 
   limit of the colorbar.
- Several enhancements to the output figures.
- Improvements for plotting of FEA results on FEM2DQ4 elements.
- Add several example test problems in "test" folder.
- Create a polygonal mesh from a 3-node triangular mesh (see folder "mesher").
- Three stabilization options are now available in the LinearElastostatics module.
- Mesh size parameter is now computed as the average area of the polygons in the mesh.
- Update VEMLAB Primer.

Version 2.3 (5-JULY-2020):

- Add possibility of using multiple materials in the Poisson module.
- Update triangulate_polygon function so that it uses the built-in triangulation matlab function.
- Bug fix in writing to txt file.
- Add possibility to write output files suitable to be read in Convex Polygon Packing (CPP) program.
- Add some options for controlling the plotting of the mesh (plot_mesh_linewidth, plot_mesh_nodes, plot_mesh_nodesize, plot_mesh_axis).
- Add sparse solver to VEM2D/FEM2D in LinearElastostatics and Poisson modules.
- Remove L-shape example from the test folder due to bad behavior in plotting stresses and strains.

Version 2.2.2 (25-OCT-2019):

- Fix function max_edge_size.m
- Add an L-shape example in the test folder
- Update calculation of the polygon's area: MATLAB's "polyarea.m" is now used

Version 2.2.1 (20-OCT-2018):

- Add option to explicitly switch off all MATLAB figures in function
  "plot_and_output_options.m".
- Facilitate compatibility to run VEMLab in Octave.
- Update manual with a guide to running VEMLab in Octave.

Version 2.2 (6-OCT-2018):

- Fix disp() in plot_and_ouput_options.m: disp("Hello") seems to work only in newer 
  versions of MATLAB. So, it is changed to the standard MATLAB format disp('Hello').
- Results that are postprocessed in the graphical user interface of GiD are now 
  ordered in folders.
- Add option to plot deformed domain in MATLAB figures when using the 
  LinearElastostatics module (see function “plot_and_ouput_options.m” located in 
  the folder “config”).
- Add a function to read a meshfile having the domain type declared as "Custom", 
  which is useful for defining the meshfile manually or using an external mesh 
  generator or using a customized version of the mesh generators available in 
  VEMLab. (See example "Creating and using a custom meshfile" in the VEMLab Primer 
  for details).
- Add more details to the VEMLab Primer.
  
Version 2.1 (17-MAY-2018):

- Add customized wrench domain (for PolyMesher mesh generator only).
- Add customized plate with a hole domain (for PolyMesher mesh generator only).
- Add the following test: "square_plate_with_source2_poisson2d.m" in test folder.
- Add the following test: "plate_with_hole_linelast2d.m" in test folder.
- Add the following test: "wrench_linelast2d.m" in test folder.
- Fix iteration counter in PolyMesher function.

Version 2.0.2 (13-MAY-2018):

- Fix several bugs when using vemlab_method='FEM2DQ4' and vemlab_method='FEM2DT3'.
- Add a control variable in config.m that permits to explicitly set the number of 
  Gauss points to integrate the FEM2DQ4 stiffness matrix and body force vector.

Version 2.0.1 (26-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- More detailed manual in folder "doc."
- Improvement to the plotting of axis and fonts in MATLAB figures.

Version 2.0 (9-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- Two-dimensional Poisson problem.
- Setup of plot and output options in function "plot_and_output_options" located 
  in folder "config". 
- Additional plotting options (stresses, strains, fluxes and gradients) to MATLAB 
  figures, text files and GiD files.
- Option to plot solutions to VTK files.

Version 1.0 (17-FEB-2018). (Initial realease of code)

- Two-dimensional linear elastostatics (plane strain and plane stress)
- Solution methods: linear VEM (polygonal elements), FEM (3-node triangles, 4-node 
  quadrilateral)
- Boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann on boundary edges; can be a constant or 
  a function.
- Meshers: PolyMesher [1], distmesh2d [2], quad4mesh; customized for rectangular 
  domains only (requires adjustments for other domain types)
- Meshes need to be generated separately and stored inside folder 'mesh_files' 
  located in folder 'test.' 
- Meshes must be generated with the functions 'create_' located in folder 'mesher.'
- Solutions can be plotted to MATLAB figures, text files and GiD files.
