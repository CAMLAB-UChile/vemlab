Version 2.2.1 (20-OCT-2018):

- Add option to explicitly switch off all MATLAB figures in function
  "plot_and_output_options.m".
- Facilitate compatibility to run VEMLab in Octave.
- Update manual with a guide to running VEMLab in Octave.

Version 2.2 (6-OCT-2018):

- Fix disp() in plot_and_ouput_options.m: disp("Hello") seems to work only in newer 
  versions of MATLAB. So, it is changed to the standard MATLAB format disp('Hello').
- Results that are postprocessed in the graphical user interface of GiD are now 
  ordered in folders.
- Add option to plot deformed domain in MATLAB figures when using the 
  LinearElastostatics module (see function “plot_and_ouput_options.m” located in 
  the folder “config”).
- Add a function to read a meshfile having the domain type declared as "Custom", 
  which is useful for defining the meshfile manually or using an external mesh 
  generator or using a customized version of the mesh generators available in 
  VEMLab. (See example "Creating and using a custom meshfile" in the VEMLab Primer 
  for details).
- Add more details to the VEMLab Primer.
  
Version 2.1 (17-MAY-2018):

- Add customized wrench domain (for PolyMesher mesh generator only).
- Add customized plate with a hole domain (for PolyMesher mesh generator only).
- Add the following test: "square_plate_with_source2_poisson2d.m" in test folder.
- Add the following test: "plate_with_hole_linelast2d.m" in test folder.
- Add the following test: "wrench_linelast2d.m" in test folder.
- Fix iteration counter in PolyMesher function.

Version 2.0.2 (13-MAY-2018):

- Fix several bugs when using vemlab_method='FEM2DQ4' and vemlab_method='FEM2DT3'.
- Add a control variable in config.m that permits to explicitly set the number of 
  Gauss points to integrate the FEM2DQ4 stiffness matrix and body force vector.

Version 2.0.1 (26-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- More detailed manual in folder "doc."
- Improvement to the plotting of axis and fonts in MATLAB figures.

Version 2.0 (9-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- Two-dimensional Poisson problem.
- Setup of plot and output options in function "plot_and_output_options" located 
  in folder "config". 
- Additional plotting options (stresses, strains, fluxes and gradients) to MATLAB 
  figures, text files and GiD files.
- Option to plot solutions to VTK files.

Version 1.0 (17-FEB-2018). (Initial realease of code)

- Two-dimensional linear elastostatics (plane strain and plane stress)
- Solution methods: linear VEM (polygonal elements), FEM (3-node triangles, 4-node 
  quadrilateral)
- Boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann on boundary edges; can be a constant or 
  a function.
- Meshers: PolyMesher [1], distmesh2d [2], quad4mesh; customized for rectangular 
  domains only (requires adjustments for other domain types)
- Meshes need to be generated separately and stored inside folder 'mesh_files' 
  located in folder 'test.' 
- Meshes must be generated with the functions 'create_' located in folder 'mesher.'
- Solutions can be plotted to MATLAB figures, text files and GiD files.
