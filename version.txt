Version 2.0.2 (13-MAY-2018):

- Fix several bugs when using vemlab_method='FEM2DQ4' and vemlab_method='FEM2DT3'.
- Add a control variable in config.m that permits to explicitly set the number of 
  Gauss points to integrate the FEM2DQ4 stiffness matrix and body force vector.

Version 2.0.1 (26-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- More detailed manual in folder "doc."
- Improvement to the plotting of axis and fonts in MATLAB figures.

Version 2.0 (9-APR-2018). The following features have been added:

- Two-dimensional Poisson problem.
- Setup of plot and output options in function "plot_and_output_options" located 
  in folder "config". 
- Additional plotting options (stresses, strains, fluxes and gradients) to MATLAB 
  figures, text files and GiD files.
- Option to plot solutions to VTK files.

Version 1.0 (17-FEB-2018). (Initial realease of code)

- Two-dimensional linear elastostatics (plane strain and plane stress)
- Solution methods: linear VEM (polygonal elements), FEM (3-node triangles, 4-node 
  quadrilateral)
- Boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann on boundary edges; can be a constant or 
  a function.
- Meshers: PolyMesher [1], distmesh2d [2], quad4mesh; customized for rectangular 
  domains only (requires adjustments for other domain types)
- Meshes need to be generated separately and stored inside folder 'mesh_files' 
  located in folder 'test.' 
- Meshes must be generated with the functions 'create_' located in folder 'mesher.'
- Solutions can be plotted to MATLAB figures, text files and GiD files.
